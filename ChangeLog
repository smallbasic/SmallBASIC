2007-12-02      version 0.9.9.0
	* moved code to subversion
	* see src/fltk/README.TXT for updated project indent settings

2007-11-03	version 0.9.8.3
	* refactored console_main
	* added the ability to include a path component in a unit name, eg:
	  import other.something.foo
	  ? foo.my_var

	  Then in the foo.bas file:

	  Unit other.something.Foo
	  export my_var

	  The unit file should be saved in $UNITPATH/other/something.
	  If not defined, $UNITPATH is inferred as the host program
	  file directory.

2007-10-10
	* A runtime error is now created in lieu of crashing when you
	  pass a value less than 0 to the LEFT and RIGHT string commands.
	* The runtime error for LEFT,RIGHT,REPLACE,MID,INSTR,RINSTR now
	  includes the invalid index in the message

2007-08-31
	* Fixed a problem referring to UDS fields from an array
	  eg x = foo(0).x

2007-08-18
	* Fixed a problem with the short-circuit eval code causing
	  incorrect true/false return IP's being calculated

2007-08-02
	* The IN operator when applied to arrays now returns
	  the 1 based index position, eg:
           a << "cat"
           a << "dog"
           ? "dog" in a 'prints 2

2007-07-21
	* Implemented experimental logical expression short-circuit evaluation

2007-07-12
	* (re) Implemented user defined structures
	* AnsiWidget added to FLTK core package

2007-06-23
	* TSAVE now correctly closes the opened file

2007-04-27
	* Added GUI support to SDL version using guichan

2007-04-19
	* Implemented user defined structures
	* Commited Attila Haraszti's SDL code and changes for configure.in
	* Added syntax support for '=='

2006-11-14
	* Updated DATE and TIME error messages to provide extra information

2006-10-23
	* Added more info the index out of range runtime error message
	* Fixed configure.in for cygwin build

2006-08-19
	* added "multiline" option to the TEXT command to support
          the multiline edit control (GTK)
	* fixed RINSTR command to work as advertised.
	* TSAVE can now take a file number arg like TLOAD

2006-08-16
	* Fixed error message with unterminated strings in a sub or func.
          complained about missing END instead of the missing " char
	* Quoted strings no longer required the end quote char. A new line is
          taken as the end of string.

2006-08-12
	* added support for func/sub pointer variables used with the
	  call statement:

          func foo(s)
           foo="foo!"+s
          end
          sub bar
            ? "in bar"
          end
          p = @foo
          ? call(@foo, "#")
          ? call(p, "%")
          pb = @bar
          call pb
          call @bar

 	* USRCALL has been removed since it never worked and the above
          is a better replacement (IMHO)

2006-07-28
	* updated chain command to take string or array	of string arguments in
          lieu of a file name. After calling this command, the calling program
	  now successfully resumes.
	* added HAVE_C_MALLOC to replace complicated
          memory routines with simple malloc/free calls
	* added GRID+TAB button support to GTK build

2006-05-27
	* added form support to GTK build

2006-05-27
	* bc_store_string() now handles escaped double quotes

2006-04-12
	* updated sockcl_open() to handle server listen sockets

VERSION 0.9.0
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2004-05-01: ndc
	Human language depented files for messages and keywords.
	The messages and the keywords can be easily translated to another language.
	This is not suggested because that means incompatible source-code but it is very usefull for education purposes;
	I believe that, the kids will work better if they are using their natural language
	(and we are very sensitive on that matter).
	I suggest to the "translators" to be very carefull, there is no mean on a word-to-word translation.

2003-03-10: ndc
	new c-modules: mod_gdbm, mod_mysql

2003-03-09: ndc
	fix: ptdistln, ptdistseg
	new: POLYCENT (centroid of polygon)

2003-02-24: ndc
	END IF: keyword with space is supported now

2003-01-24: ndc
	FOR-IN: if the IN parameter is not an array (probably an empty variable) the FOR jumps to
	--- the next command after 'NEXT'

2002-10-12: ndc
	Sort: fixed
	Search/Sort: does not generate RTE anymore

2002-10-01: ndc
	several internal changes for easy development.
	--- cxx_sb.hpp provides a new iterface to whole SB.
	--- SB can compiled as a C or C++ library. That would
	--- help a lot the IDEs developers. Main Makefile
	--- splitted, it is working like main-menu now.
	FLTK IDE added but not finished yet.
	--- Actually that shows the power of the libsbasic.
	--- It is very easy now to build IDE. Unfortunately

2002-09-16: ndc
	update: compiler speedup for PalmOS 3.5+
	--- VMTs not used on 3.5+ (no actually needed)
	new code: lopen_bridge.h
	--- I rewrote the VMTs. The code was a mess. Several parts of SB
	--- uses #def blocks just to do simple tasks with open/close command-set
	--- So, I wrote a "driver" which cleans a lot of those parts by using
	--- real std-c emu of functions open/close for PalmOS and VTOS.
	update: new VMT
	--- VMTs are now basic part of the system. Because of lopen_bridge.h is
	--- easy portable too. In VMTs is stored a fake environment-variable table,
	--- VMTs are used for memory swaping, and will be used as basic-level database.
	update: PalmOS, On PalmOS 3.5+ the opt_safedraw (SDK3.5 draw functions) is
	--- used by default on 3.5+.

	--- execution.
	update: ebm, corrected behaviour with open file errors; now results in a
	--- runtime error.
	new: ebm, absolutely way cool on-line help!
	new: ebm, removed the 2 pixel window border.
	new: ebm, partial MMC file support; reading and listing files from sb code only.
	--- MMC write is not yet implemented in the operating system.
	new: ebm, updated command line editor. Entered commands are now sent directly
	--- to the interpreter. You can tap and run simple one line programs
	--- using the keyboard. Use : to separate program statements.
	new: ebm, optional SmallBASIC.ini settings control creation of .sbx files
	--- and enabling verbose compilation. settings are:
	--- genexe=0
	--- quiet=0
	update: ebm, minor enhancements to ebjlib library
