/*    This program takes a help script and produces a help file (.HLP)   */
/*    and a help context file (.H).  The format for the help file is     */
/*    very simple.  Each context is given a symbolic name (i.e FileOpen) */
/*    which is then put in the context file (i.e. hcFileOpen).  The text */
/*    following the topic line is put into the help file.  Since the     */
/*    help file can be resized, some of the text will need to be wrapped */
/*    to fit into the window.  If a line of text is flush left with      */
/*    no preceeding white space, the line will be wrapped.  All adjacent */
/*    wrappable lines are wrapped as a paragraph.  If a line begins with */
/*    a space it will not be wrapped. For example, the following is a    */
/*    help topic for a File|Open menu item.                              */
